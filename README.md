# What. Huh.
Starting this is weird, but I want to help offer some strategy as of how to find and meet people, as well as the mindset behind it. Self doubt and anxiety can get in the way and, period, *making friends is hard. It's uncomfortable because it's uncertain*, but it is a skill that you deserve to level up in your life. It sucks being lonely, it sucks not having people you like to sorround yourself with, and no matter how introverted you are, we're all social and sensitive creatures.

We all deserve people to talk to and people to love (and love us). I've dealt with chronic lonliness throughout the years, and this is just what I've found to be helpful for me. I'm not a doctor or a professional, but I do hope this finds you and helps, even in the smallest amount.

# A kinder, better mindset towards people
